### Monster's lair: `.git` directory

.fw[![gitdir](img/gitdir.png)]

Objects - files in which git stores things. Could be blobs, trees, commits or tags. [More info](http://www.gitguys.com/topics/all-git-object-types-blob-tree-commit-and-tag/)
???

- quick look at `.git` directory & its contents

---
### where's your `HEAD` at???
<iframe class='center' width="694" height="390" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5rAOyh7YmEc?start=111" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

```bash
.git (GIT_DIR!) $ cat HEAD
ref: refs/heads/master
.git (GIT_DIR!) $ cat refs/heads/master
2627a6be868294a31a840f1a7a16a48529a569f9
```

##### Note: in git version 2.x, `.git/refs/heads` only contain recent refs. All refs are listed in `.git/info/refs` file.

![headless](img/headless.gif)

```bash
$ git checkout HEAD~2
Note: checking out 'HEAD~2'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b new_branch_name

HEAD is now at f0c93da... remotes & branches
$ cat .git/HEAD
f0c93dacd15fea671381b0521f9441b2e0c43342
```

### Remotes
- Could be any directory ending in `.git` and containing a git repo connected to internet
- Can have as many as you like
.fr[![frown](img/suspicious.png)]

### Branches
- Local - what you created locally, don't have a remote counterpart
- Local tracking - local branches that have a remote counterpart
- Remote-tracking (read-only) - all branches that exist on remote server

View local branches with `git branch -vv` (doubly verbose)
```bash
$ git branch -vv
  SITE-5393           f4f921c SITE: update favicons

### Updating remote (push) or local (pull) repo
#### Explicit - push/pull any local branch to/from any remote branch
```bash
$ git push remote_name local_branch_name:remote_branch_name
```
.note[Note: if `remote_branch_name` is omitted, git assumes it's the same as `local_branch_name`]

Example:
```bash
$ git push origin master:gh-pages
Counting objects: 3, done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 1.14 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)

- Local and remote branches, shortcuts & config to make them act as you want

---

# Dealing with rejections

First thing to do - find out how remote is different from your local branch:

```bash
git fetch origin
git log local_branch_name --not origin/local_branch_name # local commits missing on remote
git log origin/local_branch_name --not local_branch_name # remote commits missing locally
```

If logs confirm you actually want what's locally on the remote (e.g. you rewrote history) - may the force be with you:

.fr[![att](img/gpf.jpg)]

`git push --force-with-lease`

### *Use with care! This blows away your old commits on remote!*

**Note: an even stronger version is `git push --force`, that one will overwrite anyone's commits on remote.**


---
.fr[![att](img/att.jpg)]
### Configuring defaults

.block[Local config: `git config section.key value` will write into `.git/config` file.]
.block[Global config: use flag `--global` - will write into `~/.gitconfig` file.]

### Do these to start:
.sm[
```bash
git config --global push.default current
git config --global branch.autosetuprebase always
git config --global alias.lg "log --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr by %an)%Creset' --abbrev-commit --date=relative"
```]

.note.block[1st - only push single branch when using `git push`]
.note.block[2nd - default to `--rebase` when doing `git pull`]
.note.block[3rd - gives you pretty and readable log when you run `git lg`, like this:]

![glog](img/glog.png)

???
defaults.
Talk about alias.
---

### Additional useful notes:

#### Use `-t` flag to set up tracking when checking out a remote branch
.fr[![](img/foreveralonehappy.png)]

`git checkout -t origin/feature`


#### Add git branch & dirty/clean state to your prompt

Add this to your `~/.bashrc`
.note[copied from [here](https://gist.github.com/henrik/31631)]

```bash
# http://henrik.nyh.se/2008/12/git-dirty-prompt
# http://www.simplisticcomplexity.com/2008/03/13/show-your-git-branch-name-in-your-prompt/
#   username@Machine ~/dev/dir[master]$   # clean working directory
#   username@Machine ~/dev/dir[master*]$  # dirty working directory

 function parse_git_dirty {
     [[ $(git status 2> /dev/null | tail -n1) != "nothing to commit (working directory clean)" ]] && echo "*"
 }
 function parse_git_branch {
     git branch --no-color 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e "s/* \(.*\)/[\1$(parse_git_dirty)]/"
 }

## Happy Workflow
Got some work done. Check status with `git status`
```bash
$ git status
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

  deleted:    img/monster.gif
  modified:   index.html

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

  img/bunny.gif

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```
#### Staging your changes (adding them to `.git/index`)

.block[`git add .` - adds all tracked files and deletions - but not including new files]
.block[`git add -u` - adds all tracked files and new files - but not including deletions]
.block[`git add -A` - adds all files, including untracked & deleted files]
.block[`git add -p` - adds changes one bit at a time]

##### Note: in git version 2.x - `git add .` is identical to `git add -A`.

???
- mention git diff to view changes
- show add -p

#### Making a commit what does `git commit` do and what can YOU do with it

1. `$ git commit`
2. Script in `.git/hooks/pre-commit` is run, if there is one
3. If you have a commit message template set with `git config commit.template path_to_template` - it is opened with editor defined with `git config core.editor editor_command_line_name` (or default text editor with default message)
4. YOU enter the commit message. Anything starting with # is ignored.
5. Script in `.git/hooks/commit-msg` is run if defined (could be used to validate commit message format). If it exits with non-zero, commit is aborted. By default, **commit is aborted if commit message is empty**.
6. Script in `.git/hooks/post-commit` is run if defined (could be used for notifications)
7. New commit object is created and added to `.git/objects`, current branch reference in `.git/refs/heads` is updated with new commit SHA.
8. `.git/logs/refs/heads/branch_name` log gets a new entry.

.fr[![](img/satisfied.png)]
![log](img/log.png)

#### Amending a commit: `git commit --amend`

steps 1-7 are the same.

Last step - `.git/logs/refs/heads/branch_name` log last line gets a new entry with `(amend)` before commit message.
.block[Git log shows only the **NEW COMMIT SHA** & message in place of old one:]

### `git merge`

Then compares `f1` and `f2` to see if some files had same lines modified on both branches. Once conflicts (if any) are resolved and added with `git add`, you can resume merge with `git merge --continue`.
That will create a "merge" commit, and updates `ref/heads/f1` to point to it.

  9 # Commands:
 10 # p, pick = use commit
 11 # r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
 12 # e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
 13 # s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
 14 # f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
 15 # x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
 16 #
 17 # These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
 18 #
 19 # If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
 20 #
 21 # However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
 22 #
 23 # Note that empty commits are commented out
```

Change the command words in front of commits as you like, per instructions. Save and quit text editor. Observe awesomeness.

## Merge vs Rebase: pros & cons

### Pros:

Merge:
- simpler to wrap your head around
- deal with conflicts only once
- preserve commit hashes

Rebase:
- neater git history (relevant commits near each other)
- dealing with conflicts potentially more straight-forward (addressing only your code)
- no extra merge commits
- making a commit is less of a commitment, inspires making tons of tiny ones

### Cons:

Merge:
- going back in history (e.g. reverting one specific commit) is more complicated
- encourages less commits (or less pushing to remote), increasing truck factor

Rebase:
- steeper learning curve
- multiple people working on the same branch need to be more fluent in git

---
class: sm

## Merge & rebase recap:

#### `git merge point_in_history` will
- look for first common ancestor of your current state & `point_in_history`
- string together all the commits in chronological order (hence "merge")
- look for common changed files since common ancestor between your current state & point in history, if same lines were touched - keep both changes and mark them as "conflicts"
- stop for you to resolve conflicts (choose which version of change you want to keep)
- wait for you to tell it `git merge --continue` when you're done fixing conflicts
& added all the files
- create a `merge commit` that contains your conflict resolutions & metadata

#### `git rebase point_in_history` will
- check out `point_in_history`
- apply one commits on YOUR branch that follows common ancestor
- stop for any conflicts at every step (much like merge).
- wait for you to tell it `git rebase --continue` when you're done fixing conflicts
- apply next commit. Repeat until all commits on your branch have been added.

#### `git rebase --interactive point_in_history` will
- check out `point_in_history`
- open the text editor of choice with list of commits since first common ancestor.

Then you have the power to specify what you would like it to do with each commit
(instructions are provided), and saving and closing the text editor sets git free
to follow with regular `rebase` process.

#### Note: `rebase` REWRITES HISTORY - i.e. commit SHAs will change, so you will need to force push your branch if you pushed before.

# More fun stuff in happy workflow

### Cherry-picking
During merge and rebase git applies one commit at a time. YOU can do that, too, at whim - with

`git cherry-pick commit_sha`

### Checking out individual files
If you know you want a file to look like it is in `that_other_commit` or on `that_other_branch`, you can get it by

`git checkout that_other_branch path/to/file`

## Merge conflicts.
![conflict](img/merge_fail.gif)

---
class: sm

## Example:

.fr[![](img/rage.png)]

`git rebase master` (or `merge`) does not complete - there are uncommitted files!

`git status` sheds some light:

![](img/mc1.png)

---
.fr[![](img/yuno.png)]
### Backup:
Before doing something potentially scary, do a `git checkout -b my_backup_branch` for peace of mind.

### Way out - aborting what you were doing:
.block[`git rebase --abort` (for rebases)]
.block[`git reset --hard branch_name` (for merges)]

#### Reasons:
1. One commit modified the file, another deleted it.
2. Both commits modified the file

.block[First case is easy to figure out - take the file or not.]
The latter keeps both changes - and formats them as such:

```javascript
<<<<<<< HEAD
var git = ‘is awesome’;
=======
function awesomeAlerter() {
    alert(‘blah’);
}
>>>>>>> Added alert
```
---
## Resolving actual conflicts

### Option 1
Use a GUI tool. opendiff is a good one for Mac - set it as default by adding this to your ~/.gitconfig:
```bash
[merge]
  tool = opendiff
[mergetool "opendiff"]
  cmd = opendiff $LOCAL $REMOTE -ancestor $BASE -merge $MERGED
```

### Option 2
Look at `both modified` files, search for "<<<<<<", pick either HEAD option (state which the file is in BEFORE applying your commit) or bottom option (your commit's version) - **or a combination of both**. Example:

.fr[![](img/freddie.png)]
![](img/mc2.png)

???
- Resolving conflicts (it may be tedious but not hard)

# More cool stuff for unhappy workflow

### Finding when the X was removed

`git log -p` (or `--patch`) shows log with actual commit content. Searchable.

### Finding a commit that introduced a bug with `git-bisect`
Straight from the [docs](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect#_basic_bisect_commands_start_bad_good):
```bash
$ git bisect start
$ git bisect bad                 # Current version is bad
$ git bisect good v2.6.13-rc2    # v2.6.13-rc2 was the last version
                                 # tested that was good
```
Then git checks out the commit in the middle between "bad" and "good" ones, you test it - and tell it either
`git bisect good` or `git bisect bad`. Keeps narrowing it down until you find the exact commit that broke stuff.

### `git reflog`

GIT BROTHER IS WATCHING YOUR EVERY STEP. Super handy for getting back to where branch *used to be* before you screwed it up with a rebase or a merge.
