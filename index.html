### Monster's lair: `.git` directory

.fw[![gitdir](img/gitdir.jpg)]

Objects - files in which git stores things. Could be blobs, trees, commits or tags. [More info](http://www.gitguys.com/topics/all-git-object-types-blob-tree-commit-and-tag/)
???

- quick look at `.git` directory & its contents

---
### where's your head at???
<iframe width="740" height="416" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5rAOyh7YmEc?start=111" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
```bash
.git (GIT_DIR!) $ cat HEAD
ref: refs/heads/master
.git (GIT_DIR!) $ cat refs/heads/master

```

---
![headless](img/headless.gif)

```bash
$ git checkout HEAD~2
Note: checking out 'HEAD~2'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b new_branch_name

HEAD is now at f0c93da... remotes & branches
$ cat .git/HEAD
f0c93dacd15fea671381b0521f9441b2e0c43342
```
???
Demo headless state

### Remotes
- Could be any directory ending in `.git` and containing a git repo connected to internet
- Can have as many as you like
.fr[![frown](img/suspicious.png)]

### Branches
- Local - what you created locally, don't have a remote counterpart
- Local tracking - local branches that have a remote counterpart
- Remote-tracking (read-only) - all branches that exist on remote server

View local branches with `git branch -vv` (doubly verbose)
```bash
$ git branch -vv
  SITE-5393           f4f921c SITE: update favicons

### There! No longer a black box. We can see what's happening!

![](img/eyes.gif)

### Onwards to syncing repos!
---

### Updating remote (push) or local (pull) repo
#### Explicit - push/pull any local branch to/from any remote branch
```bash
$ git push remote_name local_branch_name:remote_branch_name
```
.note[Note: if `remote_branch_name` is omitted, git assumes it's the same as `local_branch_name`]

Example:
```bash
$ git push origin master:gh-pages
Counting objects: 3, done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 1.14 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
To git@github.com:istro/gittalk
   c2f3cac..f60e3fa  master -> gh-pages
```
#### Implicit - push/pull local tracking branches to/from it's remote counterparts

.fl[![pr](img/puker.png)]
.m20[Easy - just `git push` or `git pull`]

???
- Local and remote branches, shortcuts & config to make them act as you want

---
.fr[![att](img/att.jpg)]
### Configuring defaults

.block[Local config: `git config section.key value` will write into `.git/config` file.]
.block[Global config: use flag `--global` - will write into `~/.gitconfig` file.]

### Do these to start:
.sm[
```bash
git config --global push.default current
git config --global branch.autosetuprebase always
git config --global alias.lg "log --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr by %an)%Creset' --abbrev-commit --date=relative"
```]

.note.block[1st - only push single branch when using `git push`]
.note.block[2nd - default to `--rebase` when doing `git pull`]
.note.block[3rd - gives you pretty and readable log when you run `git lg`, like this:]

![glog](img/glog.jpg)

???
defaults.
Talk about alias.
---

### Additional useful notes:

#### Use `-t` flag to set up tracking when checking out a remote branch
.fr[![](img/foreveralonehappy.png)]

`git checkout -t origin/feature`


#### Add git branch & dirty/clean state to your prompt

Add this to your `~/.bashrc`
.note[copied from [here](https://gist.github.com/henrik/31631)]

```bash
# http://henrik.nyh.se/2008/12/git-dirty-prompt
# http://www.simplisticcomplexity.com/2008/03/13/show-your-git-branch-name-in-your-prompt/
#   username@Machine ~/dev/dir[master]$   # clean working directory
#   username@Machine ~/dev/dir[master*]$  # dirty working directory

 function parse_git_dirty {
     [[ $(git status 2> /dev/null | tail -n1) != "nothing to commit (working directory clean)" ]] && echo "*"
 }
 function parse_git_branch {
     git branch --no-color 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e "s/* \(.*\)/[\1$(parse_git_dirty)]/"
 }
 export PS1='\u@\h \[\033[1;33m\]\w\[\033[0m\]$(parse_git_branch)$ '
 ```

### Time to get to work!

## Happy Workflow
Got some work done. Check status with `git status`
```bash
$ git status
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

  deleted:    img/monster.gif
  modified:   index.html

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

  img/bunny.gif

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```
#### Staging your changes (adding them to `.git/index`)
.block[`git add .` - adds all tracked files and deletions - but not including new files]
.block[`git add -u` - adds all tracked files and new files - but not including deletions]
.block[`git add -A` - adds all files, including untracked & deleted files]
.block[`git add -p` - adds changes one bit at a time]

???
- mention git diff to view changes
- show add -p

#### Making a commit what does `git commit` do and what can YOU do with it

1. `$ git commit`
2. Script in `.git/hooks/pre-commit` is run, if there is one
3. If you have a commit message template set with `git config commit.template path_to_template` - it is opened with editor defined with `git config core.editor editor_command_line_name` (or default text editor with default message)
4. YOU enter the commit message. Anything starting with # is ignored.
5. Script in `.git/hooks/commit-msg` is run if defined (could be used to validate commit message format). If it exits with non-zero, commit is aborted. By default, **commit is aborted if commit message is empty**.
6. Script in `.git/hooks/post-commit` is run if defined (could be used for notifications)
7. New commit object is created and added to `.git/objects`, current branch reference in `.git/refs/heads` is updated with new commit SHA.
8. `.git/logs/refs/heads/branch_name` log gets a new entry.

.fr[![](img/satisfied.png)]
![](img/log.jpg)

#### Amending a commit: `git commit --amend`

steps 1-7 are the same.

Last step - `.git/logs/refs/heads/branch_name` log last line gets a new entry with `(amend)` before commit message.
.block[Git log shows only the **NEW COMMIT SHA** & message in place of old one:]

- History changes, so force pushing necessary

## Collaboration: merge & rebase

#### `git merge point_in_history`
...will append all commits to current branch first between common ancestor and `point_in_history` (most often a branch name - but could be a commit or a tag), then compare branches, stop for you to resolve any conflicts, and create a `merge commit`.

#### `git rebase point_in_history`
...will check out `point_in_history` and apply all commits on YOUR branch since common ancestor, stopping for any conflicts at every step. THIS REWRITES HISTORY - i.e. commit SHAs will change, so you will need to force push your branch if you pushed before.

#### `git rebase --interactive point_in_history`
...will check out `point_in_history` and open list of commits since that point in your text editor of choice. Then you have the power to specify what you would like it to do with each commit. THIS ALSO REWRITES HISTORY.

---
## Collaboration: Merge

Consider such tree, with horizontal scale being chronological and branch f1 checked out (thus HEAD points there):

![t1](img/t1.jpg)

### `git merge`

running `git merge f2` appends references to commits on branch `f2` to history of current branch (with same commit `SHA`s)
![](TODO)

???
- Getting your work up to date with others' work (merge vs rebase)
---
## Collaboration: Merge

Then compares `f1` and `f2` to see if some files had same lines modified on both branches.
If there aren't any common files - it will create an empty "merge" commit, and updates `ref/heads/f1` to point to it.
![](TODO)

If there are common files, it will keep both edits - and stop, asking you to pick which version (or combination of) you want to keep. Once conflicts are resolved, staging the changes with `git add .` and continuing merge with `git merge --continue` will create the "merge" commit with resolution of conflicts, and updates `ref/heads/f1` to point to it.

## Rewriting your own history - interactive rebase

```bash
$ git -i rebase HEAD~5
 >>> vim opens with this:
  1 pick c2f3cac add readme
  2 pick f0c93da remotes & branches
  3 pick 9d4d4f0 add a few pages
  4 pick a9c22df Add a few more pages.
  5 pick 76446d6 rebase added
  6
  7 # Rebase b10eea8..76446d6 onto b10eea8 (       5 TODO item(s))
  8 #
  9 # Commands:
 10 # p, pick = use commit
 11 # r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
 12 # e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
 13 # s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
 14 # f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
 15 # x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
 16 #
 17 # These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
 18 #
 19 # If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
 20 #
 21 # However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
 22 #
 23 # Note that empty commits are commented out
```

Change the command words in front of commits as you like, per instructions. Save and quit text editor. Observe awesomeness.

# More fun stuff in happy workflow

### Cherry-picking
During merge and rebase git applies one commit at a time. YOU can do that, too, at whim - with

`git cherry-pick commit_sha`

### Checking out individual files
If you know you want a file to look like it is in `that_other_commit` or on `that_other_branch`, you can get it by

`git checkout that_other_branch path/to/file`

---
.fr[![](img/yuno.png)]
# Unhappy workflow
### Merge conflicts.
Easy way out - aborting what you were doing:
.block[`git rebase --abort` (for rebases)]
.block[`git reset --hard branch_name` (for merges)]

Reasons:
1. One commit modified the file, another deleted it.
2. Both commits modified the file

.block[First case is easy to figure out - take the file or not.]
The latter keeps both changes - and formats them as such:

```javascript
<<<<<<< HEAD
var git = ‘is awesome’;
=======
function awesomeAlerter() {
    alert(‘blah’);
}
>>>>>>> Added alert
```
---

## Example:

`git status` sheds some light
![](img/mc1.jpg)

---
## Resolving actual conflicts

### Option 1
Use a GUI tool. opendiff is a good one for Mac - set it as default by adding this to your ~/.gitconfig:
```bash
[merge]
  tool = opendiff
[mergetool "opendiff"]
  cmd = opendiff $LOCAL $REMOTE -ancestor $BASE -merge $MERGED
```

### Option 2
Look at `both modified` files, search for "<<<<<<", pick either HEAD option (state which the file is in BEFORE applying your commit) or bottom option (your commit's version) - **or a combination of both**. Example:

.fr[![](img/freddie.png)]
![](img/mc2.jpg)

???
- Resolving conflicts (it may be tedious but not hard)

# More cool stuff for unhappy workflow

### Finding when the X was removed

`git log -p` (or `--patch`) shows log with actual commit content. Searchable.

### Finding a commit that introduced a bug with `git-bisect`
Straight from the [docs](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect#_basic_bisect_commands_start_bad_good):
```bash
$ git bisect start
$ git bisect bad                 # Current version is bad
$ git bisect good v2.6.13-rc2    # v2.6.13-rc2 was the last version
                                 # tested that was good
```
Then git checks out the commit in the middle between "bad" and "good" ones, you test it - and tell it either
`git bisect good` or `git bisect bad`. Keeps narrowing it down until you find the exact commit that broke stuff.

### `git reflog`

GIT BROTHER IS WATCHING YOUR EVERY STEP. Super handy for getting back to where branch *used to be* before you screwed it up with a rebase or a merge.
